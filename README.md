Project Summary: 

Popcorn Times is a small movie listing web app using javascript/jQuery. 
It fetches data from TMDB API and displays popular movies in a beautiful 
format. On the first page, you have option to search for your fav movie.
Once you click on the selected movie, you can view details of the movie 
such as movie name, rating and reviews. Reviews are fetched using another 
TMDB API. 

Features:
 
a) Whole functionality is written in pure front end technologies such as 
HTML/CSS and Javacript library. No backend or database is used.

b) It works asynchonously. It gives seemless navigation experience.

c) For performance gain and save server resources, API data is stored in 
a localStorage and the same localStorage is used for future data retrieval.
